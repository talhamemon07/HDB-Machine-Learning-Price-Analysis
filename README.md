This project enables one to predict HDB prices based on factors like location, flat type, flat size and its lease commencement date. 
It also weighs these factors and their importance in determining HDB pricing. 
Town:24.2%
Flat Type:3.5%
Floor Area:50.8%
Remaining Lease:21.5%

The above is what I got from my own usage, which is rather interesting as it highlights that factors that are often overlooked in HDB pricing, such as the remaining lease can actually be more important than the location of the flats
This program could in turn help buyers gauge what a reasonable price would be to purchase a resale flat, and for sellers to gauge how the market prices their flat and adjust their selling price accordingly
