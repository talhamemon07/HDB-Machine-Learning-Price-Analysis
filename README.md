# HDB Price Predictor

This project enables one to predict HDB prices based on factors like location, flat type, flat size and its lease commencement date.

## Key Findings

Fascinating insights can be drawn by how the algorithm weighs the various factors below on the influence they have on market pricing

- **Town**: 24.2%
- **Flat Type**: 3.5%
- **Floor Area**: 50.8% 
- **Remaining Lease**: 21.5%

## Insights

This analysis highlights that factors often overlooked in HDB pricing, such as the remaining lease, can actually be more important than the location of the flats. This program could in turn benefit

- **Buyers** to gauge reasonable prices for resale flats
- **Sellers** adjust their selling prices based on market factors
- **All parties** At its core, it can help to enable all stakeholders to make better decisions and reduce the information assymetry/discourage buyers and sellers from 'trying their luck' in price negotiations
